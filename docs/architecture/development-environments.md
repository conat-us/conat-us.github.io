# Development Environments

This section describes the containerised development environments that are made 
available by Conatus for 

- evaluation of standard and optional modules
- development and testing of custom modules

A development license may be necessary in some circumstances and can be ordered 
from Conatus. Our Technical Sales team will advise you if this is necessary and 
will arrange for a license key to be issued to you.
